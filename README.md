## PART 1
# TOPSIS Implementation in Python

This project implements the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method using Python.  
The program is designed as a **command-line tool** to rank alternatives based on multiple criteria.

---

##  About TOPSIS
TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique that identifies solutions closest to the ideal best and farthest from the ideal worst solution.

---

##  Features
- Command-line based execution
- Supports any number of criteria
- Validates inputs (weights, impacts, file format)
- Handles both benefit (+) and cost (−) criteria
- Generates TOPSIS score and rank
- Outputs results in CSV format

---

##  Input File Format
- First column: Alternative name (e.g., Fund Name)
- Remaining columns: Numeric criteria values only
- Minimum 3 columns required

### Example:
| Fund Name | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 |
|----------|----|----|----|----|----|
| M1 | 0.84 | 0.71 | 6.7 | 42.1 | 12.59 |

---

##  Usage
bash
python topsis.py <InputFile.csv> <Weights> <Impacts> <OutputFile.csv>

## Overview

topsis-saanvi-102483080 is a Python package designed to solve multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems using the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method.
The package allows users to evaluate multiple alternatives based on several criteria and ranks them according to their relative closeness to the ideal solution.

## Key Features
Command-line based execution
Supports any number of criteria and alternatives
Accepts weights and impacts as comma-separated inputs
Handles both benefit (+) and cost (-) criteria
Produces a ranked output in CSV format

## Installation
The package can be installed using pip.
From TestPyPI:
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ topsis-saanvi-102483080 --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple


## How to Use

Provide the input CSV file followed by the weights and impacts.
Syntax:
topsis <input.csv> <weights> <impacts> <output.csv>

Example:
topsis sample.csv "0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25" "+,+,-,+" result.csv

Note:
If weights or impacts contain spaces, enclose them within double quotes.

## Sample Input
Example Dataset
data.csv

The following dataset represents different investment funds evaluated across multiple parameters.

| Fund Name | P1   | P2   | P3  | P4   | P5    |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | --- | ---- | ----- |
| M1        | 0.84 | 0.71 | 6.7 | 42.1 | 12.59 |
| M2        | 0.91 | 0.83 | 7.0 | 31.7 | 10.11 |
| M3        | 0.79 | 0.62 | 4.8 | 46.7 | 13.23 |
| M4        | 0.78 | 0.61 | 6.4 | 42.4 | 12.55 |
| M5        | 0.94 | 0.88 | 3.6 | 62.2 | 16.91 |
| M6        | 0.88 | 0.77 | 6.5 | 51.5 | 14.91 |
| M7        | 0.66 | 0.44 | 5.3 | 48.9 | 13.83 |
| M8        | 0.93 | 0.86 | 3.4 | 37.0 | 10.55 |


## Output
The output file includes:
TOPSIS Score – numerical measure of preference
Rank – relative ranking of alternatives
Higher score indicates a better alternative.

## Assumptions
The first column contains alternative names.
Remaining columns must be numeric.
Number of weights must match number of criteria.
Impacts can only be + or -.

## Part 3
# Web Service
A Flask-based web service was developed where users can upload the input file, specify weights, impacts, and an email ID.  
Inputs are validated, TOPSIS is executed on the server, and the result file is generated.  
Email functionality is implemented using SMTP; however, live delivery may be restricted due to Gmail security policies.
